    "In your code, you define a function first. That means you specify all the instructions needed to perform that task.\n",

    "Once the function is defined, then you can call that function, so the instructions within that function can be performed or executed.\n",

    "Here's an analogy. You write out step-by-step instructions on how to bake a chocolate cake. This set of instructions can have a name: `bakeChocolateCake`. Every time you want to bake a cake, you can execute the `bakeChocolateCake` instructions. If you want 3 cakes, you need to execute the `bakeChocolateCake` instructions 3 times. The first step is defining the steps and giving it a name, which is considered defining the function. Then you can refer to the steps anytime you want them to be executed, which is considered calling the function.\n",

    "> Note: You may hear the alternate phrase \"declare a function.\" The words declare and define can be used interchangeably and have the same meaning. You may also hear the term \"function definition\" or \"function declaration\", which refer to the exact code that defines a function. In some other programming languages, declare and define have different meanings."
