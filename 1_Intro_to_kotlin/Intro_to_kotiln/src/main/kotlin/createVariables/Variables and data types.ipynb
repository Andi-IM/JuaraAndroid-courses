    "## Variables and data types\n",
    "In computer programming, there's the concept of a variable, which is a container for a single piece of data. You can envision it as a box that contains a value. The box has a label, which is the name of the variable. By referring to the box by its name, you have access to the value it holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img height=\"200\" src=\"https://developer.android.com/static/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-variables/img/c59a8a232ba06470_856.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Why store the value in a box and reference the box by its name when you can simply use the value directly? The problem is that when your code uses values directly in all the instructions, your program will only work for that specific case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an analogy that can make it easier to understand why variables are useful. The following is a letter for someone you recently met.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dear Lauren,*\n",
    "\n",
    "*It was great meeting you today at the office. I look forward to seeing you on Friday.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Have a nice day!*\n",
    "\n",
    "This letter is great, but it only works for your specific situation with Lauren. What if you find yourself writing the same letter many times but with slight variations for different people? It would be more efficient to create a single letter template, leaving blanks for the parts that can change.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dear ____ ,*\n",
    "\n",
    "*It was great meeting you today at _____. I look forward to seeing you on ____ .*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Have a nice day!*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify the type of information that goes in each blank space. This ensures that the letter template will be used as you expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dear { name } ,*\n",
    "\n",
    "*It was great meeting you today at { location } . I look forward to seeing you on { date } .*\n",

    "In the above illustration of a news app, the \"Welcome\" text, the \"Latest news for you\" heading, and the \"View more articles\" button text always stay the same. Conversely, the name of the user and the contents of each article will change, so that would be a great opportunity to use variables to hold each piece of information.\n",

    "\n",
    "You don't want to write the code (or instructions) in your news app to only work for a user named Alex, or for a news article that always has the same title and publication date. Instead, you want a more flexible app, so you should write your code by referencing variable names like `name`, `article1Name`, `article1Date`, and so on. Then your code becomes general enough to work for many different use cases where the user's name could be different and the article details could be different.\n",

    "In a maps app, you may find a details screen for each location, such as a restaurant or business.
