    "A normal part of the coding process involves making mistakes and accidentally writing invalid code. As a beginner, it may be confusing or overwhelming to encounter these mistakes. But don't worry, this is expected. Code rarely works perfectly the first time that it's written. Just like how writing a document takes many drafts, writing code can take many iterations until it works as expected.\n",

For example, if you have a typo, such as a missing quotation mark or parenthesis, the compiler won't understand your code and can't translate it into steps for the computer to perform. If your code doesn't work as expected, or you see an error message in your code editor, you have to go back to your code and fix it. The process of solving these errors is called troubleshooting.\n",
